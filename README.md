# Chara's Menu
Chara's Menu is a mod menu for Gorilla Tag, created by me, Chara30678. This menu is designed to be as useful as possible for ghost trolling or fun by providing a variety of features and options. With Chara's Menu, you can explore new functions, experiment with different settings, and have a more personal modding experience.

## Can I take code from this?
Yes, if you're following the GPL-3.0 license guidelines. If you're interested in using any code, it must be open sourced. You can find my contact information on my [linktree](https://linktr.ee/Chara10163) or in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GXsK5gcFJp). I'm happy to discuss any potential collaborations, so don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or ideas.
